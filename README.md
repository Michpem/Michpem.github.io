# Masterlink's SPC700 Music Repository

A collection of my SPC700 music. Most of these were made with AMK, but from 2022 on, I intend to work mostly with AMFR.

You're free to use and edit any of these for your hacks or to submit the unedited versions to SMWC, but please don't claim them as your own. Also, before you submit anything, please contact me through Discord (M.#8038) or by posting in the [Discussion thread](https://github.com/Michpem/Michpem.github.io/discussions/1), just so I know what's happening to my music.

The songs will be on different folders depending on what tool they're compatible with, though anything compatible with stock AMK is compatible with AMKFF, and everything compatible with AMK and AMKFF will be compatible with AMFR in the future.
