	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br><br>
	
	<h3>Why is there no MML download for your AMFR music?</h3>
The tool is still in its early development stages, as such, its syntax might change in future versions. Once there is a public release of the tool, I will update the MMLs and put them up for download here.
	<h3>Do I have to give you credit for using these in my hack?</h3>
All I really ask is that you don't claim my stuff as your own. Whether or not you add my name to your hack's credits is up to you.
	<h3>Can I edit the music to my liking?</h3>
Absolutely! Though you might want to keep those edited versions for yourself, as I'd prefer them not to "replace" my versions.
	<h3>Can I submit your music to SMWC?</h3>
For sure! However, <a href="https://github.com/Michpem/Michpem.github.io/discussions/1">please let me know first</a>.
	<h3>I found errors in your port(s). What can I do?</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/Michpem/Michpem.github.io/discussions/3">Post them here.</a> I'll do my best to fix them as soon as possible.
	<h3>Do you take requests?</h3>
I generally only take requests from friends, but I may port something for you if I happen to really like the song. However, do keep in mind that if I end up doing a request for you, <u>the port will be publicly available.</u>
	<h3>Do you take commissions, then?</h3>
I'm open to talk about it, but there's still no guarantee that I'll accept them. This can be due to many reasons, like me disliking the song, me having little time at the moment, the song being unfeasable to port, or simply not feeling like it.
	<h3>How can I contact you?</h3>
Hit me up on Discord (M.#8038) or Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/Masterlink01">@Masterlink1</a>) if you want to contact me. If I don't respond, feel free to poke me, because I might have read your message and forgot to reply.
	<h3>Can I upload your music to YouTube?</h3>
Sure, why not! However, please don't monetize the video; it's unethical to take somebody else's hard work and profit from it. Also, please link the <a href="../Index.html">main page</a> in either the description or a pinned comment so people can find more of my work.
	<h3>Will you ever come back to SMWC?</h3>
No. I no longer have any interest in the site or its community. I keep contact with most friends I made there through other communities anyway.
