# Masterlink's SPC700 Music Repository

A collection of my SPC700 music. Most of these were made with AMK, but from 2022 on, I intend to make more for AMFR.

You're free to use any of these in your hacks or to submit them to SMWC, but please don't claim them as your own. Also, before you submit anything, please contact me through Discord (M.#8038) or by opening an issue here.

The songs will be on different folders depending on what tool they're compatible with, though anything compatible with stock AMK is compatible with AMKFF, and everything compatible with AMK and AMKFF will be compatible with AMFR in the future.
